# Pomodoro Chrome Extension

Welcome to the Pomodoro Chrome Extension! This handy tool is designed to boost your productivity by employing the Pomodoro Technique â€“ a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Our extension is simple to use: just click on the extension icon in your Chrome browser to start a Pomodoro session. You'll be notified when it's time to take a break, and again when it's time to get back to work. Customize your work and break durations to suit your personal productivity style. Stay focused, manage your time better, and get more done with our Pomodoro Chrome Extension!
